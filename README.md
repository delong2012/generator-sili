# generator-srfrnk-webapp

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) to generate [WebApp](https://github.com/srfrnk/WebApp).


## Installation

* npm install -g yo
* npm install -g generator-srfrnk-webapp

## More docs at [WebApp](https://github.com/srfrnk/WebApp).

## Getting Started

After all is installed you can use Yo to create a skeleton web-app this way:
* mkdir "your folder goes here"
* cd "your folder goes here"
* yo srfrnk-webapp

Use the skeleton to build your App.
When you need to add a new file use the following command (from within the app folder ;) :
* yo srfrnk-webapp:add file

It'll ask you all bunch of questions then make the changes - and you get a new file!

If you think it can be better in any way please mail or comment!
